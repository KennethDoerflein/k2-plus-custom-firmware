# Calibration

The default configuration expects the stock Creality PRTouch strain gauges for bed probing.

## Required after installation

These are the only calibration steps required for the default setup.

### 1. Probe Calibration (PRTouch)

The default probe mode is `prtouch`. **No manual probe calibration is required.** The PRTouch strain gauges automatically establish nozzle Z=0 dynamically during probing.

### 2. Calibrate the cutter

```gcode
CALIBRATE_CUT_POS
```

### 3. Calibrate input shaper

```gcode
SHAPER_CALIBRATE
SAVE_CONFIG
```

The analysis step can take a while because the printer's SoC is slow at processing resonance data.

## Other calibration and maintenance

Nothing below is part of the normal initial setup.

### Probe modes

The default probe mode is **PRTouch-only** (`prtouch`). 
If you wish to use an aftermarket Cartographer probe, you can switch modes using the bootstrap script:

Check the current mode:
```sh
bootstrap --probe
```

Switch modes:
```sh
bootstrap --probe prtouch
bootstrap --probe mix
bootstrap --probe carto
```

- `prtouch` (Default): PRTouch only. No probe calibration required.
- `mix`: Cartographer scans the bed; PRTouch establishes nozzle Z=0.
- `carto`: Cartographer only.

*(Note: Cartographer and mixed modes expect the 5.8 mm Y-endstop spacer. PRTouch-only mode does not.)*

#### Cartographer & Mixed-mode calibration
If you switch to `carto` or `mix`, you must calibrate the Cartographer probe:
```gcode
G28
CARTOGRAPHER_TOUCH_CALIBRATE METHOD=touch
CARTOGRAPHER_SCAN_CALIBRATE
```
For `mix` mode, follow up with `PRTOUCH_SCAN_CALIBRATE` after homing.

### Motor calibration

The firmware will tell you when a motor is uncalibrated and needs `MOTOR_CALIBRATE`. It is also worth trying when troubleshooting print or motor issues.

For X, Y, Z, or Z1:

```gcode
MOTOR_CALIBRATE AXIS=X
```

The first run does not calibrate anything. It disables the motors and asks you to place the printhead near the middle and the bed at the bottom. Move them there by hand, then run the same command again.

Extruder calibration is two-stage and must be run with filament unloaded:

```gcode
MOTOR_CALIBRATE AXIS=E STAGE=encoder
# Power cycle the printer.
MOTOR_CALIBRATE AXIS=E STAGE=offset
```

### Belt tension

Automatic tensioning is normal belt maintenance:

```gcode
BELT_TENSION
```

Use `BELT_TENSION AXES=X` or `BELT_TENSION AXES=Y` to tension one axis.

#### Belt tension sensor recalibration

Do not run this as routine setup. It is only for incorrect tension readings or specific troubleshooting, and requires the [printed calibration jig](https://www.crealitycloud.com/model-detail/belt-tensioning-module-calibration-tool). Normal automatic belt tensioning does not require it.

Home and park the carriage where the middle of the selected belt is accessible, then capture the normal and jig loads:

```gcode
BELT_TENSION_CALIBRATE AXIS=X POINT=LOW
# Install the jig.
BELT_TENSION_CALIBRATE AXIS=X POINT=HIGH
# Remove the jig, then home before moving the printer.
```

Repeat for `AXIS=Y`.
